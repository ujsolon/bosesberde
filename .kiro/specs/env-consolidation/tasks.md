  - Update remaining .env.example files to reference master configuration
  - Create migration documentation explaining the changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2.2 Verify deployment script compatibility
  - Confirm deploy-all.sh uses master .env file correctly
  - Verify chatbot deployment script loads master configuration
  - Ensure all deployment scripts work with consolidated approach
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 3. Validate consolidated configuration
