# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The embedded chatbot currently fails to work properly when embedded in cross-site contexts due to cookie security restrictions. Modern browsers require cookies used in cross-site contexts to be marked with both `SameSite=None` and `Secure` attributes. The current implementation causes authentication failures and prompts users to login when the chatbot is embedded on external domains, specifically due to the AWSALBCORS cookie not meeting these requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing an embedded chatbot, I want the authentication and session management to work properly in cross-site contexts, so that I can use the chatbot without browser security errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cookies are set in a cross-site embedded context THEN the system SHALL mark them with both `SameSite=None` and `Secure` attributes
2. WHEN the embedded chatbot loads THEN authentication flows SHALL complete without "cross-site cookie" browser warnings
3. WHEN load balancer cookies (like AWSALBCORS) are set THEN they SHALL be configured with appropriate cross-site attributes
4. WHEN the application is accessed over HTTPS THEN all cookies SHALL use the Secure attribute for cross-site compatibility
