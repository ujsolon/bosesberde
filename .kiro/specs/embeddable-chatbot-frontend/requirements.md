# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds the capability to embed the chatbot frontend into external websites while maintaining security through domain validation. The system will provide a separate embeddable interface that can be integrated into third-party websites via iframe or direct embedding, with deployment-time configuration for allowed domains to prevent unauthorized usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to embed the chatbot frontend into my website, so that my users can access the chatbot functionality without leaving my site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the embeddable chatbot endpoint THEN the system SHALL render a streamlined chatbot interface optimized for embedding
2. WHEN the embeddable interface is loaded THEN it SHALL maintain all core chatbot functionality including messaging, tool execution, and file uploads
3. WHEN the embeddable interface is displayed THEN it SHALL have a responsive design that adapts to different container sizes
4. WHEN the embeddable interface loads THEN it SHALL remove navigation elements and branding that are not suitable for embedding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure allowed domains during deployment, so that I can control which websites can embed the chatbot and prevent unauthorized usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the deployment process SHALL prompt for a list of allowed domains for embedding
2. WHEN a request is made to the embeddable interface THEN the system SHALL validate the request origin against the configured allowed domains
3. WHEN a request comes from an unauthorized domain THEN the system SHALL reject the request with an appropriate error message
4. WHEN no domains are configured THEN the system SHALL NOT allow embedding from any domain (development mode)
5. WHEN domain validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the unauthorized access attempt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the chatbot, I want clear documentation and examples for embedding, so that I can easily integrate the chatbot into my website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the embeddable interface is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide iframe embedding code examples
2. WHEN accessing the embeddable interface directly THEN it SHALL include usage instructions and integration examples
3. WHEN embedding via iframe THEN the system SHALL support proper iframe communication for resizing and events
4. WHEN integrating the chatbot THEN developers SHALL have access to customization options for styling and behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of an embedded chatbot, I want the same functionality as the standalone version, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of how I access the chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the embedded chatbot THEN all messaging functionality SHALL work identically to the standalone version
2. WHEN using the embedded chatbot THEN all tool execution capabilities SHALL be available
3. WHEN using the embedded chatbot THEN file upload functionality SHALL work properly
4. WHEN using the embedded chatbot THEN session management SHALL maintain conversation state
5. WHEN using the embedded chatbot THEN authentication SHALL work if required

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the embedded chatbot to maintain the same authentication requirements as the standalone version, so that security and access control remain consistent across all interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the embedded chatbot THEN users SHALL be required to authenticate via Cognito
2. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the embedded chatbot SHALL redirect to the Cognito login flow
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the embedded chatbot SHALL maintain the user session consistently with the standalone version
4. WHEN authentication fails or expires THEN the embedded chatbot SHALL handle re-authentication gracefully within the embedded context
5. WHEN the embedded chatbot loads THEN it SHALL respect all existing user permissions and access controls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor embedded chatbot usage, so that I can track adoption and identify potential security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the embedded chatbot is accessed THEN the system SHALL log the embedding domain and usage metrics
2. WHEN unauthorized embedding attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log security events with domain information
3. WHEN the embedded chatbot is used THEN usage analytics SHALL distinguish between embedded and standalone access
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN administrators SHALL have visibility into which domains are actively using the embedded chatbot
